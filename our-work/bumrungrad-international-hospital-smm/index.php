Recognizing the importance of social media in enhancing audience engagement and building trust, Bumrungrad International Hospital partnered with us to elevate their online presence. Our expertise in content management and strategic social media planning was instrumental in developing a comprehensive approach tailored to their needs.</p>
                                <p class="_mb-60">We focused on creating a dynamic content marketing strategy for their social media platforms, aimed at engaging a diverse audience and maintaining interest in their healthcare services.

                                <h3 class="_mb-40">Formulation of Marketing Strategy</h3>
                                <p>In developing a robust social media marketing strategy for Bumrungrad International Hospital, we began with a comprehensive analysis of the competitive landscape in medical tourism, particularly focusing on the increasing number of patients seeking treatment abroad. We aimed to set realistic and attainable goals that resonated with our defined audience segments. Notably, the robust growth in medical tourism directed our focus towards the Middle East and Far East markets, identifying key demographics such as high-income individuals and those seeking high-quality medical care abroad.</p>
                                <p>Our strategy emphasized audience segmentation, understanding that each group required a bespoke approach. We identified the primary age demographic as 25-55 years, with a core focus on individuals aged 30-50. Additionally, recognizing various levels of demand in medical tourism, we tailored our marketing efforts to engage different audience segments: from those already familiar with treatment in Thailand to those still exploring their options. Our approach involved not only highlighting the benefits of treatment in Thailand but also specifically guiding potential patients to choose Bumrungrad Hospital for their healthcare needs.</p>
