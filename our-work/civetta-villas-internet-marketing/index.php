                                <p>Our comprehensive approach to developing Bumrungrad International Hospital's social media content strategy began with a detailed analysis of competitors in the global healthcare sector. We scrutinized the social media presence of international medical institutions, identifying their strengths and weaknesses, particularly those catering to the Middle East and Far East markets. This analysis was crucial in understanding the landscape and positioning Bumrungrad Hospital distinctively.</p>
                                <p>Our positioning strategies were carefully formulated to consistently convey the hospital's key messages to the audience. We focused on two main strategies:</p>
                                <ul class="_list">
                                    <li><span class="_bold">Brand Positioning:</span> This strategy was centered around increasing the audience's familiarity with Bumrungrad Hospital. We highlighted the hospital's wide range of services, its state-of-the-art facilities, and competitive advantages through engaging social media posts. This approach was designed to establish Bumrungrad as a leading healthcare provider in the minds of potential patients.</li>
                                    <li><span class="_bold">Benefit Positioning:</span> In this strategy, we emphasized the unique advantages of seeking treatment at Bumrungrad Hospital. Beyond showcasing cost-effective solutions, we also highlighted emotional appeals and the exceptional quality of care provided. This strategy was aimed at creating a compelling narrative around the benefits of choosing Bumrungrad for medical needs.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Content categorization played a vital role in our strategy, allowing for systematic organization and targeted delivery of our messages. The primary content categories included:</p>
                                <ul class="_list">
                                    <li>The service provides a distributor with the module depicting reports that can be uploaded.</li>
                                    <li>Report list:</li>
                                    <li>Basic information about Bumrungrad Hospital;</li>
                                    <li>Detailed insights into the services provided;</li>

                                </ul>
                                <p class="_mb-10">Through this strategic approach to content creation and categorization, we ensured that every piece of content served a specific purpose, targeting different levels of audience demand and engagement. The result was a highly effective content plan, tailored to resonate across varied social media platforms and with diverse audience segments, reinforcing Bumrungrad International Hospital's position as a top destination for medical tourism.</p>
                                <h3 class="_mb-40">SEO</h3>
                                <p>Before starting work on SEO just like with PPC, the market analytics was carried out, competitors and growth points were identified. After that the following was performed:</p>
                                <ul class="_list">
                                    <li>Semantics divided into geo-dependent and geo-independent queries was collected and clustered;</li>
                                    <li>The system of visibility analytics in search engines was set up;</li>
                                    <li>The algorithm to generate meta tags was developed and implemented;</li>
                                    <li>More than 20 SEO texts were written and posted;</li>
                                    <li>Micro-markup was implemented;</li>
                                    <li>The system of page interlinking was developed and implemented;</li>
                                    <li>All content duplicates were found and removed, with HTML code optimized.                                        </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Within the working process the regular analytics of all intermediate results was carried out to reveal and remove any errors which can directly or indirectly (through deteriorating behavior characteristics) produce any negative effect on positions.</p>
