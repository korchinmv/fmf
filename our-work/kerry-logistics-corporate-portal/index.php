                                <p>At this stage the software architect constructed the application structure scheme as well as described the integration points with external software products. The basis of the application architecture involved the use of existing sophisticated techniques to create modular software systems designed for high loads. Modules are designed to realize the functionality overlapping the customer's business needs. The labor costs were evaluated to implement this architecture.</p>
                                <p>The original data allowed to developing the site map describing the most optimal and friendly-user routes of receiving the key information.</p>

                                <p>The main concept was to provide a simplified basic interface with the possibility of personalization. It was proposed to implement the abundance of portal functionality by means of pluggable widgets.</p>

                                <p>Our key advantage lies in the desire to produce products having maximum efficiency. Our goal is to develop tools that will enable customers to solve their business-tasks in full. Based on the mentioned above, our colleagues at Kerry Logistics asked us to work out the methodology for implementing the corporate portal and its further technical support. Eventually, it was presented, including:</p>
                                <ul class="_list">
                                    <li>The formation of a customer’s working group of 4-5 people, where is a manager responsible for the interaction with our representative.</li>
                                    <li>Buying and setting up hosting as well as placing the ready software product on a demo server (staging server) and production server (production server).</li>
                                    <li>Providing the access to the portal and operating documentation (user and administrator’s instructions).</li>
                                    <li>Training the working group by our specialists.</li>
                                    <li>Checking the software product compliance with the technical assignment by the working group, then they present claims to be removed if they fit the original requirements. In case of improvements are beyond the agreed TA, an additional agreement is made to insert the improvements.</li>
                                    <li>Signing the delivery-acceptance certificate, transferring full rights for the hosting and software product (including the source code).</li>
                                    <li>Additional training of a group including 20 customer’s representatives.</li>
                                    <li>Automatic notification of the company’s employees about a new software product.</li>
                                    <li>Providing one calendar month of warranty information technology support, some minor malfunctions can be eliminated.</li>
                                    <li>(Optional) Providing a contract for the technical support of the project. The technical support is supplied in packages of 30hrs, 50hrs or 100hrs (cost to be added). The technical support also includes the services on assisting Kerry Logistics representatives to implement and update the system. One task cannot require workhours more than 50% of the selected technical support package. When tasks exceed 50% of the selected support package, additional agreements are to be signed. At the end of each month a full technical support report is to be provided.</li>
                                    <li>(Optional). Making a technical assignment for the second stage, signing an agreement for further product development.</li>
